# Project Aether

Project Aether is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) initiative that focuses on low-cost, long-range capabilities with a high endurance VTOL (Vertical Takeoff and Landing) design powered by an internal combustion engine. The project employs a combination of programming languages, including C#, C++, Python, and Lua.


## Project Subcomponents
1) #### User Interfacer ####  
   The project's user interface offers operators an easy-to-use interface for quick access to information. It allows monitoring the status of the UAV, mission details, and other critical data.

2) #### Antenna Tracking System ####  
   Aether's antenna tracking system is engineered to provide precise and effective position tracking. This system optimizes the communication of the UAV and supports high-performance data transfer.

3) #### Autopilot Computer #### 
   Aether's autopilot computer manages the UAV's flight automatically, handling tasks ranging from low-level control to high-level mission planning.

5) #### Central Control Computer #### 
   The central control computer integrates all subsystems of the project, enabling comprehensive management and coordination of the UAV.

6)  #### UHF and C Band Communication System #### 
    The UHF and C Band communication system in Aether ensures a powerful and reliable communication infrastructure, facilitating secure data exchange during long-range missions.

7) #### UAV Design ####
   Aether's design includes the use of aerodynamic and lightweight materials so that it can achieve long range and high airtime.
